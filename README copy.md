# My Topic Google Doodle
The topic of my Google Doodle is cats. I chose cats because they are my favorite animal and I draw them often in my free time. People often write off cats as being too temperamental, but I find they fail to pay attention to catâ€™s body language. When designing, I knew I wanted to use different parts of the cat body to make up the letters. I relied on the bodies of the cats to imply the letters that spell out Google. The tails make up the capital G and lower-case g. Animating the tails to slowly move back and forth make the cats seem relaxed.
